# Smart-Robot-Cleaner

The algorithm is written with python and the simulation is simulated with amino. 

Amino can be downloaded following the guide from the amino website: http://amino.dyalab.org/download.html

The algorithm is written purely with planning algorithm. The specific algiorithm involved are A* algorithm and planning under uncertainties technique.

Please view the video 'simulated_video.mkv' for the simulated result.
